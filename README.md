# Tris

Game made with the help of a close friend during summer vacation. I worked on the UI and controlls while he worked on the AI.

#Build and run
We used codeblocks IDE to made this program, but every other IDE should work if compatible with c++.

#Play
Use the Arrows to move the selector, press space to set the mark. The game stops when the player or the pc wins.
